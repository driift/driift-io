      <p>The DRIIFT package includes everything you need for powering up your conference. We design and provide NFC cards and lanyards and we power up the event with a variety of DRIIFT applications and utilities.</p>

      <h2>Card &amp; Lanyard design</h2>
      <p>Give DRIIFT your logo and colour scheme and we'll deisgn a card and lanyard for your event. You can choose lanyard colour and what sponsor logos you'd like to see. The card on your lanyard will look beautiful and will come powered up with a DRIIFT NFC tag, allowing your event attendees to access the DRIIFT website tailored for your event.</p>

      <h2>Entrance wizzbang</h2>
      <p>As your delegates arrive, DRIIFT scans lanyards, checking people into the conference.</p>

      <h3>Your name in lights</h3>
      <p>At registration, DRIIFT displays a personalised welcome message to delegates as they arrive on a big screen - "Welcome to [YOUR CONFERENCE] Joe Bloggs".</p>

      <h3>Welcome email</h3>
      <p>DRIIFT needs to send delegates an email to verify their account when their tag is first scanned. You can customise the content specifying their own welcome message, information, sponsor details and more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h2>Contact sharing</h2>
      <p>The DRIIFT web app allows delegates with NFC capable phones to scan each other to exchange contact details.</p>

      <h3>Givaways</h3>
      <p>Sponsors or stall holders with NFC capable phones can give away products in exchange for contact details. The DRIIFT web app displays scan counts which can help store owners to restrict the number of givaways per delegate.</p>

      <p>Collected contact details can be exported as CSV.</p>

      <h3>Post conference email</h3>
      <p>After the conference DRIIFT can optionally send an email to each delegate with a summary of the contacts they collected during the conference. This is a chance for you to send discount codes to delegates and/or mention sponsor names one last time (for instance).</p>

      <h2>Digital badges</h2>
      <p>Collect event memorabilia in the form of digital badges awarded for achievements.</p>
      <p>By default DRIIFT will award badges to attendees who arrive at an event, and also award a "super connector" badge to any attendee who contact shares with &gt; 5 other attendees. Organisers and speakers are also awarded special badges.</p>
      <p>Badges are sticky between events DRIIFT are involved with.</p>
      <img src="http://tableflip.io/content/images/2014/Jun/badges.png">
      <p>Depending on your event requirements, DRIIFT can design badges to be awarded at various points at your event. For example, attending workshops, parties etc. NOTE: this service is an additional bolt on, please contact us for pricing.</p>

      <h2>Event schedule</h2>
      <p>Your event attendees will be able to access the conference schedule to see what's currently going on and what's up next.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h2>Attendee directory</h2>
      <p>The attendee directory is a living list of attendees that have arrived. If you have attendees at your event who want to meet up, then they don't have to spend their time looking for a friend or colleague who hasn't arrived yet.</p>
      <p>The directory also displays badges earnt by each attendee, allowing people with similar interests to meet up or simply for highlighting special guests.</p>
