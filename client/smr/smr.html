      <h1>Silicon Milk Roundabout 8</h1><ul><li>Duration: 2 days</li>
      <li>Date: 15th - 16th November</li>
      <li>Up to 4000 attendees</li>
      <li>160 exhibitors</li></ul>

      <p><b>Outline</b></p><p></p><p>This is the 8th and largest SMR yet. This year we are looking at ways to improve contact exchange and data collection as part of the event.</p><p></p><p>We will give each exhibitor access to the DRIIFT scanning app via the Google Play store or pre-installed on a rented handset.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Every attendee will be given an NFC badge associated with their DRIIFT profile. Before the event we will populate attendee profiles from the data provided to SMR.</p><p></p><p>During the event, exhibitors will build up a record of the attendees they have interviewed by scanning their badge. After an interview they are prompted to file the candidate, starring those to follow up with and discarding those that are not relevant.</p><p></p><p><b>Benefits</b></p><p></p><p>The goal is to streamline the experience for the companies looking for candidates.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>To reduce the complexity of comparing thousands of candidates, DRIIFT will show a standardised view of their profiles and portfolios. We will provide an intuitive system for recording which candidates they met and capture their initial assessment of suitability.</p><p></p><p>These are steps that companies must perform regardless, but current systems are ad-hoc and the key information they capture is not visible. By using DRIIFT, SMR will have access to all that data, get insight in what value companies really derive from the event and have a feedback loop for improving their attendee vetting process.</p><p></p><p><b>Timeline</b></p><p></p><ul><li>By Oct 13th - Agree scope, fee, and sign off.</li>
